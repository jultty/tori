tori is designed to be portable so that its features allow transfering your configuration between different versions of an operating system or even between different operating systems depending on the presently supported ones.

To aid this portability and ability to run in different systems, it is also designed to have minimal dependencies since it is meant to run on brand new systems where very few packages have been installed.
